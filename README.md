Hi, welcome to my QA Wolf assignment submission!
Run 'npm install' command to install necessary packages and 'npm run test' or 'npx playwright test' to run the tests.
I wasn't sure how to update the index.js file to run the tests without breaking the standard coding conventions, so I wrote a separate test file (just like Playwright documentation suggests) and added an NPM script to run it. I explain this decision a little bit more in my Loom video.
I am using Github to version control this project, you can check some of my work-in-progress commits here: https://github.com/Asileka/qa_playwright_tests1
Please don't hesitate to contact me with any feedback or questions!
